- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PrinceAli
- :shrug: This is GitHub template for my information. Because I work for big companies and they have lawyers, I keep my codes to myself.
- ðŸ‘€ My main interest is Automation. Humans are not good at repetitive tasks, machines on the other hand are. 
- :book: As a SWE at Google, I had Python and Go readability.
- ðŸŒ± [As of Q1 2021] Iâ€™m currently learning GraphQL.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.
